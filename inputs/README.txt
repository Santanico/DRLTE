The title means the setups of simulation
e.g. NSF_c1000_s10_SHR_p3_r60_80
topology: NSF
capacity: 1000Mbps
session number: 10
ways getting predefined paths: top-k shortest path
maximum number of paths for each session: 3
minimum rate of session: 60Mbps
maximum session of session: 80Mbps


possible topos: 
	NSF 
	1221 
	.etc
possible ways getting predefined paths:
	MCF
	SHR
	SRO


PS:inputKite.txt is used for testing, you can ignore that when simulation
