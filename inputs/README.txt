The title means the setups of simulation
e.g. NSF_s20_SHR_p3_r20_30
topology: NSF
session number: 20
ways getting predefined paths: top-k shortest path
maximum number of paths for each session: 3
minimum rate of session: 20Mbps
maximum session of session: 30Mbps


possible topos: 
	NSF 
	1755 
	1221 
	.etc
possible ways getting predefined paths:
	MCF
	SHR
	SRO


PS:inputKite.txt is used for testing, you can ignore that when simulation
